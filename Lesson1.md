## Strings

strings can be delimited by single or double quotation marks.

```
single_quoted_string = 'I love SG'
double_quoted_string = "I love SG"
```

You can create multi-line strings using three double quotes:
```
multi_line_string = """ I love SG.
I love food courts here.
I love always summer climate """
```
